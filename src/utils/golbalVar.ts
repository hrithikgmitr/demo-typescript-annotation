export const STRING_VALUE = `The year was 2081, and everybody was finally equal. They weren’t only equal before God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarter than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the 211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General.<br/>
<br/>
Some things about living still weren’t quite right, though. April, for instance, still drove people crazy by not being springtime. And it was in that clammy month that the H-G men took George and Hazel Bergeron’s fourteen-year-old son, Harrison, away.<br/>
<br/>
It was tragic, all right, but George and Hazel couldn’t think about it very hard. Hazel had a perfectly average intelligence, which meant she couldn’t think about anything except in short bursts. And George, while his intelligence was way above normal, had a little mental handicap radio in his ear. He was required by law to wear it at all times. It was tuned to a government transmitter. Every twenty seconds or so, the transmitter would send out some sharp noise to keep people like George from taking unfair advantage of their brains.<br/>
<br/>
George and Hazel were watching television. There were tears on Hazel’s cheeks, but she’d forgotten for the moment what they were about.<br/>
<br/>
On the television screen were ballerinas.<br/>
<br/>
A buzzer sounded in George’s head. His thoughts fled in panic, like bandits from a burglar alarm. <br/>
<br/>
“That was a real pretty dance, that dance they just did,” said Hazel.<br/>
<br/>
“Huh?” said George. <br/>
<br/>
“That dance—it was nice,” said Hazel.<br/>
<br/>
“Yup,” said George. He tried to think a little about the ballerinas. They weren’t really very good—no better than anybody else would have been, anyway. They were burdened with sash weights and bags of <b>birdshot</b>, and their faces were masked, so that no one, seeing a free and graceful gesture or a pretty face, would feel like something the cat drug in. George was toying with the vague notion that maybe dancers shouldn’t be handicapped. But he didn’t get very far with it before another noise in his ear radio scattered his thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
George winced. So did two out of the eight ballerinas.<br/>
<br/>
Hazel saw him wince. Having no mental handicap herself, she had to ask George what the latest sound had been.<br/>
<br/>
“Sounded like somebody hitting a milk bottle with a ball-peen hammer,” said George.<br/>
<br/>
“I’d think it would be real interesting, hearing all the different sounds,” said Hazel, a little envious. “All the things they think up.”<br/>
<br/>
“Um,” said George.<br/>
<br/>
“Only, if I was Handicapper General, you know what I would do?” said Hazel. Hazel, as a matter of fact, bore a strong resemblance to the Handicapper General, a woman named Diana Moon Glampers. “If I was Diana Moon Glampers,” said Hazel, “I’d have chimes on Sunday—just chimes. Kind of in honor of religion.”<br/>
<br/>
“I could think, if it was just chimes,” said George.<br/>
<br/>
Well—maybe make ’em real loud,” said Hazel. “I think I’d make a good Handicapper General.”<br/>
<br/>
“Good as anybody else,” said George.<br/>
<br/>
“Who knows better’n I do what normal is?” said Hazel.<br/>
<br/>
“Right,” said George. He began to think glimmeringly about his abnormal son who was now in jail, about Harrison, but a twenty-one-gun salute in his head stopped that.<br/>
<br/>
Boy!” said Hazel, “that was a doozy, wasn’t it?”<br/>
<br/>
It was such a doozy that George was white and trembling, and tears stood on the rims of his red eyes. Two of the eight ballerinas had collapsed to the studio floor and were holding their temples.<br/>
<br/>
“All of a sudden you look so tired,” said Hazel. “Why don’t you stretch out on the sofa, so’s you can rest your handicap bag on the pillows, honeybunch.” She was referring to the forty-seven pounds of birdshot in a canvas bag, which was padlocked around George’s neck. “Go on and rest the bag for a little while,” she said. “I don’t care if you’re not equal to me for a while.”<br/>
<br/>
George weighed the bag with his hands. “I don’t mind it,” he said. “I don’t notice it any more. It’s just a part of me.”<br/>
<br/>
“You been so tired lately—kind of wore out,” said Hazel. “If there was just some way we could make a little hole in the bottom of the bag, and just take out a few of them lead balls. Just a few.”<br/>
<br/>
“Two years in prison and two thousand dollars fine for every ball I took out,” said George. “I don’t call that a bargain.”<br/>
<br/>
“If you could just take a few out when you came home from work,” said Hazel. “I mean—you don’t compete with anybody around here. You just set around.”<br/>
<br/>
If I tried to get away with it,” said George, “then other people’d get away with it—and pretty soon we’d be right back to the <b>dark ages</b> again, with everybody competing against everybody else. You wouldn’t like that, would you?”<br/>
<br/>
“I’d hate it,” said Hazel.<br/>
<br/>
“There you are,” said George. “The minute people start cheating on laws, what do you think happens to society?”<br/>
<br/>
If Hazel hadn’t been able to come up with an answer to this question, George couldn’t have supplied one. A siren was going off in his head.<br/>
<br/>
“Reckon it’d fall all apart,” said Hazel.<br/>
<br/>
“What would?” said George blankly.<br/>
<br/>
“Society,” said Hazel uncertainly. “Wasn’t that what you just said?”<br/>
<br/>
“Who knows?” said George.<br/>
<br/>
The television program was suddenly interrupted for a news bulletin. It wasn’t clear at first as to what the bulletin was about, since the announcer, like all announcers, had a serious speech impediment. For about half a minute, and in a state of high excitement, the announcer tried to say, “Ladies and gentlemen—”<br/>
<br/>
He finally gave up, handed the bulletin to a ballerina to read.<br/>
<br/>
“That’s all right—” Hazel said of the announcer, “he tried. That’s the big thing. He tried to do the best he could with what God gave him. He should get a nice raise for trying so hard.”<br/>
<br/>
“Ladies and gentlemen—” said the ballerina, reading the bulletin. She must have been extraordinarily beautiful, because the mask she wore was hideous. And it was easy to see that she was the strongest and most graceful of all the dancers, for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two-hundred-pound men.<br/>
<br/>
And she had to apologize at once for her voice, which was a very unfair voice for a woman to use. Her voice was a warm, luminous, timeless melody. “Excuse me—” she said, and she began again, making her voice absolutely uncompetitive.<br/>
<br/>
“Harrison Bergeron, age fourteen,” she said in a grackle squawk, “has just escaped from jail, where he was held on suspicion of plotting to overthrow the government. He is a genius and an athlete, is under-handicapped, and should be regarded as extremely dangerous.”<br/>
<br/>
A police photograph of Harrison Bergeron was flashed on the screen—upside down, then sideways, upside down again, then right side up. The picture showed the full length of Harrison against a background calibrated in feet and inches. He was exactly seven feet tall.

export const string2=`<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="lessonTitle">\n<p class="body_lt_dropCap">Today, the United States is a synthesis, or combination, of people from around the world. The first people arrived in the Americas at least 10,000 years ago. A survey of how these indigenous people lived before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas in 1492 provides the context for understanding the interaction of the Europeans and Native Americans and the impact this had on both groups. Columbus’s first voyage was a turning point in world history because it initiated lasting contact between people on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean. His voyages, followed by European exploration and settlement in the Americas, had profound results on how people on every continent lived.</p>\n\n<p class="body_lt_text">Another landmark change came in 1607 with the founding of the first permanent English settlement at Jamestown, Virginia. The Jamestown settlement marked the beginning of the framework of a new nation.</p>\n\n<p class="body_lt_text_runin"><b class="runin">Cultural Diversity in the Americas</b> When Columbus reached the Americas, the existing cultures varied greatly, partially because of differences in geography and climate. Each culture developed distinctive traits in response to its environment, from tropical islands where sugar grew to forests rich in animal life to land with fertile soil for growing corn (maize). Native Americans also transformed their environments. For example, people in dry regions created irrigation systems, while those in forested regions used fire to clear land for agriculture.</p>\n\n<p class="body_lt_text_runin"><b class="runin">Motives for Exploration</b> The European explorers in the Americas—first the Spanish and Portuguese, then the French and Dutch, and later the English—competed for land in the Americas. Some were motivated by desires to spread Christianity. Others hoped to become wealthy by finding an all-water route to Asia, establishing fur-trading posts, operating gold and silver mines, or developing plantations. Europeans often relied on violence to subdue or drive away native inhabitants.</p>\n\n<p class="body_lt_text_runin"><b class="runin">Transatlantic Exchange</b> Contact between Europeans and the natives of America touched off a transatlantic trade in animals, plants, and germs known as the Columbian Exchange that altered life for people around the globe. Crops originally from America such as corn (maize), potatoes, and tomatoes revolutionized the diet of Europeans. However, germs that had developed in Europe caused epidemics in the Americas. Typically, the native population of a region declined by 90 percent within a century after the arrival of Europeans.</p>\n\n<p class="body_lt_text_runin"><b class="runin">Addition of Enslaved Africans</b> Adding to the diversity of people in the Americas were enslaved Africans. They were brought to the Americas by Europeans who desired low-cost labor to work in mines and on plantations. Africans, like Native Americans, resisted European domination by maintaining elements of their cultures. The three groups influenced the others’ ideas and ways of life.</p>\n\n<p class="body_lt_text_runin"><b class="runin">European Colonies</b> Within a century of the arrival of Columbus, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and settlers developed colonies that depended on natives and enslaved Africans for labor in agriculture and mining precious metals. In particular, mines in Mexico and South America produced vast amounts of silver that made Spain the wealthiest European empire in the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>\n\n<div class="flushLeft" style="margin-top:1em;"><img alt="Timeline of events 1450 to 1650. 1492 Europeans discover a new world across the Atlantic Ocean. 1492 The Columbian Exchange of goods and diseases across The Atlantic begins. 1494 The Treaty of Tordesillas divides Spanish and Portuguese claims in the Americas. 1512 Spain subjugates Native Americans through the encomienda system. 1525 The transatlantic slave trade begins expanding. 1607 the first permanent English colony is established at Jamestown." src="https://assets.perfectionlearning.com/res/APUSH/U1Timeline_1450_1650.svg" /></div>\n</div>\n`
